# [TO-DO]


- [ ] replace manual handling msgs with auto-managed ones `from langchain.memory import StreamlitChatMessageHistory`
- [ ] make an example `data.csv` file to store user preference for food and restaurant. I am thinking a column of restaurant and another column of scale.
- [ ] add in a csv drop in UI for the user to upload their own csv. Add it to Buffer memory somehow.
- [ ] add a surprise feature button. Once it's ticked it will randomly generate a surprise restaurant out of user's comfort zone.
